OOP: Object Oriented Programming

A) Abstraction
B) Encapsulation
C) Inheritance
D) Polymorphism

A) Abstraction: Implementation hiding

Interface vs Abstract class:

Interface is a roadmap/contract between the classes.

In interface, you are allowed to declare methods but not implement it.

In abstract class, you are allowed to have non-abstract method which is implemented and abstract method which is declared only.
